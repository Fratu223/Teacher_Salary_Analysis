# Teacher_Salary_Analysis
This repo is for an analysis of the average teacher salary in the united states compared with the cost of living index for each individual state. This is part of my quest to find out which state would you be better off having a career in teaching. Other variables, like average house price, may be added in the future.

## Visual Graph Analysis

For the Visual Graph Analysis, I normalized the average yearly income of teachers by state and the cost of living index in general and for different categories (groceries, health, housing, miscellaneous, transportation, utilities) and compared them.
