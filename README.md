# Teacher_Salary_Analysis
This repo is for an analysis of the average teacher salary in the united states compared with the cost of living index for each individual state. This is part of my quest to find out which state would you be better off having a career in teaching. Other variables, like average house price, may be added in the future.

## Data

## Visual Graph Analysis

For the Visual Graph Analysis, I normalized the average yearly income of teachers by state and the cost of living index in general and for different categories (groceries, health, housing, miscellaneous, transportation, utilities) and compared them.

## Results of Visual Graph Analysis

Considering all of the graphs shown above, it can be concluded that the state of Hawaii has a problem when it comes to the difference between the cost of living and the anual mean income of teachers. Most states have no problem providing a liveable salary to their teachers, however states like Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Missouri, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, North Dakota, South Carolina, South Dakota, West Virginia and the aforementioned Hawaii cannot provide an average life, economically speaking, for their teachers. Obviously, context is not taken into consideration when it comes to the conclusion above, however it is still interesting to observe. On the other side, the top 5 states when it comes to making their teachers lifes' easier form an economical stand point are New York, Washington, California, Illinois and Conneticut. Again, these are simple observations without context, which can lead to bias. There are many more conclusions that can be taken from the data showcased, these are simply some of the main points.
